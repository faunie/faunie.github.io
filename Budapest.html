    <p> Walk across the Chain Bridge to the Buda side, take the Siklo (Buda Hill Funicular) up to the castle. Walk around castle hill, make sure you go see the cobble stone streets, as well as Fisherman's Bastion. You will have an amazing view of the Pest side and the Parliament. After that take the walking path up to the Citadella, it's about 45 minute walk and you will have to ask which way to go. But totally worth it. Don't walk the same path down, take the path that leads straight down. That way on your way back to the Pest side you can walk along the Danube back to the Chain Bridge. </p>

<p>I would highly recommend going to the Basilica twice. Once during the day and once at night. It's beautiful when lit up. Make sure you go to Vaci Utca and eat a fresh pastry at Cafe Gerbeaud, the inside of the building is beautiful and also extremely old so it has history. From Vaci Ter, you can walk off into any direction on the cobble stone, super awesome architecture and small tight streets that will give you the European feeling. If you walk north on one of the streets, keeeeeep walking and you will eventually hit the big indoor market called Great Market Hall (Nagy Csarnok) it's right by the Freedom Bridge for reference. Check that out, super cool and I would recommend eating here too. You can buy souvenirs for people here. </p>

<p>You MUST walk along the Danube on the Pest side, start far north and walk south towards the Parliament. Really beautiful view of Buda, but also really amazing historical statues along the way. Look for the "Shoes on the Danube" it's really powerful. Then you will hit the parliament, don't pay for an inside tour, it's not worth it. On the other side of the Parliament there is a Square that's has green grass to sit in and just check out the statues and walk around a bit. </p>

<p>Another place that you must check out both day and night is Heroes Square. Beautiful when lit up at night. It's on the complete other side of town (Pest) so make a day trip of that. I would go there spend some time at Heroes Square, then there's a castle near by that I can't remember the name of, but you will see it and you can walk around that area. Then I would eat around there. Then I would go to the Szecsenyi Thermal baths, it's the most famous one in Budapest, spend some time there. But I would do that late afternoon until night fall, that way when you leave there you can walk back to Heroes square and see t at night. </p>

<p>If you have time, take a tram to Margaret Island. Make a picnic out of it, buy some delicious Hungarian fresh buns, green pepper, fresh salami, and Hungarian spreadable cheese and just go picnic there and walk around the island. If you get far enough back you can see the ruins of the castle that got destroyed during the war. Cool stuff. </p>

<p>I would say, for a short trip those are the main must see attractions. </p>

<p>Eat at Fozelek Falu, cheap, simple and delicious. </p>

<p>Go to awesome bars at night like Morrisons 1 and 2. There is a bar called Simpla that I would always take my friends too. Really cool theme and they have Hungarian beers on tap there. </p>

<p>Any questions? </p>
