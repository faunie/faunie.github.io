    <h1>My Life in a Nutshell</h1>
    
    <p> I was born in Tatab&aacute;nya, Hungary. My family and I moved to the states when I was 6 years old, to live the "American dream." I spent my life moving from place to place with my mother. When I graduated highschool I moved to Hawaii for college. After that I moved back to Hungary to teach English to both kids and adults. Once that passion passed I knew it was time for something new, something crazy, so I went to work in Antarctica. I did two seasons down South working as a Janitor. Two of the best years of my life. No rent, no need to buy food, just saving money, paying my student loan, meeting amazing people and researching where to travel to next. Spent two amazing years of my life working for 6 months, traveling for 6 months. I knew this couldn't continue so I set up shop in Denver, Colorado. I had an awesome job, I helped lauch car2go (the countries #1 carsharing service), had an awesome roommate, adopted a cat, then adopted a dog. But, because I spent my entire life moving, this life only lasted for a year. Which brings me to where I am now. Portland, Oregon. The greatest city in America, well that's my opinion. I now live here with my two amazing animals that I mentioned above. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT HERE, enough to spend the rest of my life here.....Maybe.
